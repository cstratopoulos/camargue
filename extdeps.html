<div class="textblock"><p>Camargue would not exist without heavy reuse of facilities from Concorde, CPLEX, and C++11/the C++ STL. The philosophy has been to reuse code from these sources wherever reasonably (and sometimes unreasonably) possible. In light of this, remaining dependencies have been implemented on an as-you-like basis.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the README, </p><pre class="fragment">./cmr_install.sh -F
</pre><p>does a full install with all the dependencies described below. To add individual ones, it should be sufficient to run <code>make clean</code> and then <code>cmr_install.sh</code> with a flag option. The flags are indicated below in corresponding sections, with a brief mention of what the install script does.</p>
<p>The add-ons are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#gmi">Primal separation of safe Gomory cuts</a></li>
<li><a href="#catch">Unit tests and benchmarks with Catch</a></li>
<li><a href="#omp">Shared-memory parallelism with OpenMP</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#gmi">Safe Gomory Cuts</a> </h2>
<p>In "Primal Cutting Plane Algorithms Revisted", Letchford and Lodi describe how to generate Gomory cuts that solve the primal separation problem. To avoid issues with edge pricing, Gomory cuts are only used on sparse instances. In these cases, though, their effect on the solution process is quite dramatic. For an idea of how they are called in Camargue, see the documentation for <a class="el" href="class_c_m_r_1_1_sep_1_1_safe_gomory.html">CMR::Sep::SafeGomory</a>.</p>
<p>Safe Gomory cuts are implemented using the code of William Cook, Sanjeeb Dash, Ricardo Fukasawa, and Marcos Goycoolea, provided as a supplement to their paper "Numerically
Safe Gomory Mixed-Integer Cuts" in the Informs Journal of Computing. The code is available as a supplement from the publisher <a href="https://www.informs.org/Pubs/IJOC/Online-Supplements/Volume-21-2009/Cook-Dash-Fukasawa-Goycoolea">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not already have the code, running </p><pre class="fragment">`./cmr_install.sh -s`
</pre><p>will download the gzipped tarball at the link above. It will then be extracted and placed in <code>camargue/externals</code>. The script will then make some minor edits to some files in <code>safemir/src</code>. Some of the edits just prevent compiler warnings, but others are required for the project to compile.</p>
<p>If you have already downloaded the code with the link above, create a softlink to the directory <code>safemir</code> in the <code>camargue/externals</code> folder. So <code>safemir</code> must be the name of the file containing the folder <code>src</code>. If you already had the code downloaded, you will still need to make the automated changes just described. Running <code>./cmr_install.sh -s</code> should do these, but you can also call <code>scripts/edit_safemir.sh</code> from the camargue directory.</p>
<h2><a href="#catch">Catch Unit Tests</a> </h2>
<p>This section just describes installation of the Catch unit testing framework. For info on running the tests, and suggested usage, see <a class="el" href="utests.html">Catch Unit Tests</a>.</p>
<p>The current version of Camargue has been developed in a test driven fashion with the help of the unit testing framework <a href="https://github.com/philsquared/Catch">Catch</a>: C++ Automated Test Cases in Headers. To use it with Camargue, just put the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philsquared/Catch/master/include/catch.hpp">Catch header</a> (or a symlink to it) in the 'camargue/externals' folder. Running </p><pre class="fragment">./cmr_install.sh -c
</pre><p>will place the actual header there directly with a simple <code>curl</code> script, as will the <code>-F</code> full install option.</p>
<p>To compile Camargue in testing mode, use the recipe <code>make test</code>. This edits a line in <a class="el" href="config_8hpp.html" title="Configuration macros. ">config.hpp</a> to enable testing, <code>make</code>s the project, then reverts <a class="el" href="config_8hpp.html" title="Configuration macros. ">config.hpp</a> afterward. Thus, subsequent calls to <code>make</code> should just build the normal command line executable. This will <em>not</em> happen if, for some reason, the compilation process is killed midway through <code>make test</code>. In this case, <code>make remake</code> should revert <a class="el" href="config_8hpp.html" title="Configuration macros. ">config.hpp</a> and allow the normal Camargue main to be built.</p>
<p>If you want to run the tests, there are some requirements on what your <code>camargue</code> directory has to look like. Most importantly, all the tests search for TSPLIB instances in a folder called <code>problems</code> in the Camargue directory, so at <code>camargue/problems</code>. Thus, if you have a folder containing the TSPLIB instances from <a href="http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/tsp/">here</a>, and you have extracted all problems, just create a symlink to the containing folder in the <code>camargue/</code> directory. The other requirement is the <code>test_data</code> folder. This folder contains three subdirectories:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tours</code> for (often suboptimal, sometimes deliberately terrible) TSP tours</li>
<li><code>subtour_lp</code> for files with names like <code>att532.sub.x</code></li>
<li><code>blossom_lp</code> for files with names like <code>d493.2m.x</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The latter two are cases where Concorde was used with the flag <code>-i</code> or <code>-I</code> to solve over the blossom or subtour polytope, respectively. If you don't have these files, the script <code>make_test_data.sh</code> can be used to generate them, provided</p>
<ul>
<li>you have linked to a working build of Concorde in <code>externals</code>, and</li>
<li>you have created the <code>problems</code> symlink in the camargue directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have some files but not others, the script will do a simple check before actually invoking Concorde.</p>
<p>Be warned that the tests contain examples of size up to and including the largest instance, <code>pla85900</code>, so the test script may take a little while to run (although Concorde still finds the subtour polytope optimum extremely quickly). If you would rather not run this or other giant instances, you can just remove them from the problems folder. The script will still show "file not found" error from Concorde, and an error will be reported on the corresponding unit tests, but everything else will proceed as usual.</p>
<p>The exception to these are a family of extremely tiny examples that I created, <code>blossom6.tsp</code>, <code>comb9.tsp</code>, <code>fleisA9.tsp</code> and <code>fleisB9.tsp</code>. The instances <code>blossom6</code> and <code>comb9</code> are familiar blackboard examples used to illustrate subtour and comb inequalities. The instances <code>fleisA9</code> and <code>fleisB9</code> are an attempt to recreate Figures 2 and 5 from Fleischer et al.'s 2006 paper on simple DP inequalities. These TSP instances have been placed in the <code>test_data</code> directory, with tours and LP solutions in subdirectories as appropriate.</p>
<p>If you want to develop or modify tests, repeatedly calling <code>make test</code> will cause slower compile times, so it would be better to manually change the <code>CMR_DO_TESTS</code> line in <a class="el" href="config_8hpp.html" title="Configuration macros. ">config.hpp</a> and change it back when you are done.</p>
<h2><a href="#omp">OpenMP Parallelism</a> </h2>
<p>There are a few separation routines in the code that can be implemented to run in parallel. I have chosen to implement this using the <a href="http://www.openmp.org/">OpenMP</a> standard for an extremely simple approach. Unlike the other external dependencies, this one is not a download. Rather, the <code>configure.sh</code> script will try to test if your compiler supports OpenMP (OMP), and edit the <code>Makefile</code> accordingly. Unlike the other examples, there is no script that will download anything: if your compiler doesn't support OMP it is probably not worth it to download and install a new one just for that.</p>
<p>In "Primal Separation Algorithms", Letchford and Lodi observe that the minimum cut computations in their blossom separation algorithm are "independent of each other", so I have implemented these to run concurrently. And in my approach to primal simple DP separation, it is possible to search the Karp partitioned witness cutgraphs in parallel. From a practical point of view in either case the speedup is pleasant but not earth shattering, as neither separation routine is called terribly often.</p>
<p>The OMP standard dictates that if the compiler does not support OMP <code>#pragma</code>s, they are simply ignored and the result is still valid code. However in my implementations there is a bit of added overhead for memory management or error checking, so the result is not as clean as the implementation that could be used in the serial case. </p>
