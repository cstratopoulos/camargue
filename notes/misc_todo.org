Miscellaneous todo list type tasks
* CutControl
** TODO Rename files to something that doesn't start with cut
** TODO Make cut<> classes unique_ptrs which are set up each time
* Separator classes
** TODO Add additional constructor which is just passed datagroups
** TODO Maybe pass edge_marks by value
* DataGroups
** TODO Rename edge_marks to node marks!!
* lp
** TODO Put everything in PSEP namespace
** TODO Make functions accept vectors instead
** TODO Also pass m_lp by reference instead of address each time
* Miscellaneous
** TODO Get rid of m_prefixes in members!!
* Safe GMI
** TODO Make it so the Cut<safeGMI> template is actually used!
* Cuts
** TODO Get rid of the CutQueue template specialization
** TODO Add clear() method to CutQueue
** TODO Maybe better flesh out the Cut template?
- Could have something like Cut<internal_t, external_t> where internal_t
is the cut being separated, and external_t is how it will be stored in
the pool. For segments/blossoms external_t would be hypergraph, for
simpleDP it will be whatever I come up with, for safeGMI probably
internal = external.
- Alternatively, just make safeGMI not be a Cut template since it is
  so different.
* Fastblossoms
** TODO Fix bug in oc_sep
Currently code gets locked in get_delta during oc_sep somehow. This
happens independent of any parallel features. 
* TODO Fix d2103 bug
With the file d2103 solution w infix random seed, either CutTranslate
gets passed an empty row or a connect cut is infeasible???
