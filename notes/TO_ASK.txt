Column Generation
    Is it necessary to ever optimize the LP or do we just work with reduced
    costs (and the dual solution) from the most recent non-degenerate pivot?

Cut pruning
    If we only prune cuts after every augmentation, a great number will
    accumulate in the LP. In Concorde, cuts whose dual variable is less than
    0.001 after 10 LP solves are deleted from the LP. What might be a primal
    analogue of this? 
    Considerations:
	-LP Solves in Concorde happen only after every 250 cuts
	-One LP solve may consist of hundreds single pivots

Branching
    What variable selection rule is used? Strong, most infeasible, etc.? 
    Suppose we are in a DFS traversal of the tree, and we eventually perform
    a right branch (adding many rows). Right branches at further depth are 
    simply performed by changing the sign of these inequalities. But what if
    the right branch is fathomed, and we have to perform another right branch
    closer to the root?
