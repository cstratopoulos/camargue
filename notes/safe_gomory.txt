Reference functions from safe_mir code:

gen_slvr.hpp: SLVRtableauRow for how a Binv row and row of the matrix are
	      used to get a single row of the tableau
	      Sets constraint sense to 'G' (even though it is 'E')
	      Checks that the desired row number is basic (!!!)
	      

sys_cuts.hpp: CUTSaggregateSystem for how Binv and matrix row are aggregated
	      in SLVRtableauRow
	      
	      CUTSaddMulTo for how individual multiplications are safely 
	      performed by setting rounding direction

Basic outline:

1. Get tableau row -- performed for each fractional (basic? nonbasic?) variable
