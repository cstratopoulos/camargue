Reference functions from safe_mir code:

gen_slvr.hpp: SLVRtableauRow for how a Binv row and row of the matrix are
	      used to get a single row of the tableau
	      Sets constraint sense to 'G' (even though it is 'E')
	      Checks that the desired row number is basic (!!!)
	      Calls CUTSaggregateSystem with corresponding Binvrow and entire
	      system of equations
	      

sys_cuts.hpp: CUTSaggregateSystem for how Binv and matrix row are aggregated
	      in SLVRtableauRow
	      For each row of the system of equations, CUTSaddMulTo multiplies
	      the ith row by the ith entry of the multiplier vector (which is
	      Binv in this case)
	      
	      CUTSaddMulTo for how individual multiplications are safely 
	      performed by setting rounding direction
	      Each nonzero entry of the row is safely multiplied by the 
	      corresponding multiplier, by first setting rounding mode

Seemingly...all this is passed to MIRsafeGetMir (safe_mir_dbl.cpp)
