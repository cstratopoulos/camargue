just make timer a namespace and profiler have the void print profile
functions
or maybe re-explore timer class and name class for protection now that
i know how static member vars work.............

create different datagroup structures e.g., SupportGroup for support
indices, elist,  ecap, and support graph, BestGroup for best tour
nodes and edge, lp  group for lp edges and lp object, etc. etc. and
pass groups to  initializers rather than long lists of disjointed vectors

possibly switch to unique_ptr vectors for segments and blossoms as
well, could be faster for priority queue sorting/inseration

in subtour poly should be G_Utils::CC_cut?
