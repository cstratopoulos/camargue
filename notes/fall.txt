TOPIC GOALS FOR FALL 2016

1. Read/solve sparse TSPs
   Idea: To get a better idea of scaled performance of code with larger
   	 instances, try running solution protocol on sparse TSP instances
	 arising from generated edge sets
   Approach: Use concorde edgegen.c to generate an initial edge set; we may
   	 as well use the 10 LK/quad nearest approach. After that, use these
	 edges to initialize the Graph structure, rather than the complete 
	 graph edges. 
	 No additional edge elimination should be performed during the 
	 PureCut loop. 

2. Improve simple DP sep
   -Speed up odd cut computation (Letchford paper)
   -Reduce collection of candidate light teeth (Fleischer paper)

3. Column generation (will require hypergraph cuts)

4. Primal separation heuristics for combs or chains
