* Simple DP TODO list
** DONE Investigate stalling/amount of violation in cuts
   CLOSED: [2016-11-21 Mon 15:50]
** Tooth
*** TODO Add mulitple versions of weak elim for right-adjacent/general
*** DONE Replace hash maps with arrays in linsub_allcuts cb
CLOSED: [2016-11-25 Fri 15:19]
*** TODO Adapt weak elim to unsorted (or possibly unmerged?) lists
The idea here is to sort AFTER elimination has occurred, which should
net a marginal speedup. Possible approaches:
- Use std::move to merge the lists, record indices of iterators
- Compare the disjoint lists separately
** CutControl
*** TODO Add in_subtour_poly to DP time
*** TODO Make it so add_primal_cuts can return rval of 2
** PureCut
*** TODO Possibly rewrite entirely
** Timing
*** TODO Create timers for all subroutines
