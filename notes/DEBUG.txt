Random sample debugging (as per Mike Dunlavey on stack ex)
       -pstack $(jobs -p) to call for the process stack on the current
       job (assuming no other process is running)

       -gdb ./PSEP, then run [arglist]
       	    C-c to interrupt
	    bt to backtrace the stack
	    c to resume

With gdb, try compiling without optimizations, eg., -g -O or just -g
for most accurate results
