SEEMING CANDIDATES FOR SPEEDUPS/STORAGE SAVERS:

cutting routines:
replace all to iterate over the edges of the support graph, including segment
support graph should be reconstructed every time a round of cutting planes is
about to take place, thus it can be used in all cutting plane routines

delta/E(S) routines:
possible that there is no need for s_edge_marks, just edge_marks will suffice
see bill's code subtour_hw.c: functions clean up after themselves in a minimal
way by
resetting to zero only those values which were set to 1

tooth slack:
there is a lot of repeated computation in computing the slack for a tooth with
body
S and then one for S u {i}. Maybe possible to write an incremental version of
get_slack that reuses the data; would possibly give drastic speedups

pivoting:
come up with an actual implementation of primal pivot that doesn't involve
optimizing the whole LP at every step.
